## Subcommands

For all `embed_id` parameters, the naming rule is as follows: The id must be alphanumeric and may include dashes (-) and underscores (_) but no other special characters.

### list
* Signature: `list`
* Parameters: None
* Examples:
  - $embed list
  
Lists the ids of all embeds save in this server. Will be improved.

### queue
* Signature: `queue [embed_id] [channel] [time]`
* Parameters:
  - embed_id: The id of an embed saved in the server's embed list
  - channel: The channel to display the embed in, must be "mentioned" as part of the message
  - time: The time that the embed will be sent. See examples for valid datetime formats
* Examples:
  - $embed queue id912 #channel 2020-10-8 11:00 AM CDT
  - $embed queue id912 #channel 2020 10 8 11:00 AM CDT
  - $embed queue id912 #channel 2020 Oct 8 11:00 PM CDT
  - $embed queue id912 #channel 2020 October 8 11:00 PM CDT

Queues the embed with id `embed_id` to show up in the specified `channel` at the given `time`. If not enough arguments are given, the `embed_id` doesn't follow the naming rules, the embed with id `embed_id` doesn't exist, the channel doesn't exist, or if the time is invalid, no embed will be queued and the user will be notified. If the embed already queued, then this will override the previous channel and time.

Valid datetime formats include:
* [YYYY]-[m]-[d] [hr]:[min] [AM|PM] [timezone]
* [YYYY] [m] [d] [hr]:[min] [AM|PM] [timezone]
* [YYYY] [month abbr.] [d] [hr]:[min] [AM|PM] [timezone]
* [YYYY] [month] [d] [hr]:[min] [AM|PM] [timezone]

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/parse for more information about valid datetimes. Chances are if it is parsable (i.e. not NaN), it is valid.

### dequeue
* Signature: `dequeue [embed_id]`
* Parameters:
  - embed_id: The id of an embed saved in the server's embed list
* Examples
  - $embed dequeue id912

Removes the embed with id `embed_id` from the queue, so it will not be automatically sent. If the `embed_id` doesn't follow the naming rules or the embed with `embed_id` doesn't exist, no embed will be removed from the queue and the user will be notified. If the embed was not queued in the first place, then nothing happens.

### show
* Signature: `show [embed_id]`
* Parameters:
  - embed_id: The id of an embed saved in the server's embed list
* Examples:
  - $embed show id912
  - $embed show ywer1Yw

Sends the data of the embed with id `embed_id` into the channel that the command was called in. If the `embed_id` doesn't follow the naming rules or the embed with `embed_id` doesn't exist, no embed will be shown and the user will be notified.

### new
* Signature: `new [embed id]?`
* Parameters:
  - **Optional** embed_id: Set a specific id for the new embed.
* Examples:
  - $embed new
  - $embed new my_special-ID9
  
This subcommand will start editing a new embed with an autogenerated id, if an `embed_id` is not given. If the given `embed_id` doesn't follow the naming rules or is the same as an existing embed, no embed will be edited and the user will be notified. This command does not save to the server's embed list, so remember to `$embed save`!

### edit
* Signature: `edit [embed_id]`
* Parameters:
  - embed_id: The id of an embed saved in the server's embed list
* Examples
  - $embed edit my_special-ID9
  
This subcommand will open the editor to edit an embed with the given id `embed_id`. If the given `embed_id` doesn't follow the naming rules or the embed with `embed_id` doesn't exist, no embed will be edited and the user will be notified. If another embed is already being edited, the other embed will stay in the editor and the user will be notified.

### save
* Signature: `save`
* Parameters: None
* Examples
  - $embed save

This subcommand will save the embed currently in the editor. If no embed is being edited, the user will be notified.

### cancel
* Signature: `cancel`
* Parameters: None
* Examples:
  - $embed cancel

This subcommand will revert all changes done to the embed in the editor. Users have the option of confirming or cancelling the revert. On confirmation, changes to the embed in the editor will be discarded. Please note that this action is **NOT** reversible!

  - embed_id: The id of an embed saved in the server's embed list
* Examples:
  - $embed delete id192

If the given `embed_id` doesn't follow the naming rules or the embed with `embed_id` doesn't exist, no embed will be deleted and the user will be notified. Users have the option of confirming or cancelling the deletion. On confirmation, the embed will be removed from the server's embed list. Please note that this action is **NOT** reversible!
